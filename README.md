# Face Mask Recognition using Principal Component Analysis
Face mask Recognition is a Biometric Technology of identifying an individual wearing a mask by comparing live capture or digital image data with the stored record for that person.

The COVID–19 virus can be spread through contact and contaminated surfaces. There are so many essential equipment’s needed to fight against the Corona virus. One of such most essential is Face Mask. Firstly, a face mask was not mandatory for everyone but as the day progresses scientists and Doctors have recommended everyone to wear a face mask. So to detect whether a person is wearing Face Mask or not is an essential process to implement in the society currently which can be used for various applications like at the airport, hospitals, offices, schools, etc. This system can be of great importance at airports to detect travelers whether they are wearing a mask or not and at schools to ensure students are wearing a face mask for their safety. Face masks have been employed as a public and  personal health control measure against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In both community and healthcare settings, their use is intended as a source control to limit transmission of the virus and personal protection to prevent infection.

Types of Face Mask Recognition :
1. Based on Local Regions    2. Based on Global Appearance

## Haar Cascade Classifier 
Haar Cascade Classifier is based on the Viola-Jones Recognition algorithm which is trained by giving some input images and training a classifier that identifies a face with mask.  Haar Cascade Classifier is a machine learning object Recognition algorithm used to identify objects in an image trained by superimposing the positive image over a set of negative images.

# Principal Component Analysis
PCA is a dimensions reduction technique where in the data is compressed in a way that the main features of the data are preserved.
PCA reduces dimensions of the data and accurately decompose the face structure into the orthogonal principal components known as ‘Eigenfaces’.
PCA explains the variance-covariance structure among a set of variables through a few linear combination of these variables.
